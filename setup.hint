ldesc: "Md5deep is a suite of tools to compute hashes, or message 
digests for any number of files while optionally recursively digging 
through the directory structure.  It can also take a list of known 
hashes and display the filenames of input files whose hashes either do 
or do not match any of the known hashes."
